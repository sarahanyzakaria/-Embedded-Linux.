In AVR applications,  especially in embedded systems and microcontroller programming, static  libraries are preferred over dynamic libraries for several  reasons:

(1)**Resource Efficiency:**  AVR microcontrollers have constrained resources, and static libraries optimize the utilization of both Flash memory and RAM, ensuring efficient use of available space. in In static library unused functions or code can be stripped away, resulting in a smaller  binary size. This is particularly important in embedded systems where  memory is at a premium.

(2)**Predictability:** With static libraries, everything is resolved  at compile-time, and the program's behavior is more predictable. Dynamic libraries introduce an additional layer of complexity, making it harder to predict the program's behavior precisely.

(3)**No Dynamic Linker Overhead:** Dynamic libraries require a dynamic linker/loader, which adds some overhead during runtime. In  resource-constrained environments like AVR microcontrollers, minimizing  runtime overhead is important for achieving better performance.

(4)**Portability**: The applications with static libraries involves sharing a  single binary file and the associated library, streamlining the  distribution process. This simplicity is valuable in scenarios where  deployment needs to be efficient and user-friendly.
